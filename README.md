## Hi there, I'm Siobhan Gallagher 👋

🚀 Career Pivot

Transitioning from 35+ years in administration, event, and project management to the tech industry.

🎨 Creative Mindset

I'm exploring the creative aspects of coding — working with colour, fonts, and layouts to build in a digital space. 👩‍💻

As an avid creator, I have an enjoyment for working in analogue with fountian pens and ink, as well as fibre arts including knitting & spinning. 

🐱 Beyond the Screen

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me with a cat on my lap, knitting needles in hand, and a pot of tea within arm’s reach. 🍵
